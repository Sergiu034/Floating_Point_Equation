2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/fp_equation_solver_0/inst/Multiplier_AX/carry5_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/fp_equation_solver_0/inst/Multiplier_AX/carry1_reg_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/fp_equation_solver_0/inst/Multiplier_AX/carry1_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/fp_equation_solver_0/inst/Multiplier_BY/carry5_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/fp_equation_solver_0/inst/Multiplier_BY/carry1_reg_i_2__0/O, cell design_1_i/fp_equation_solver_0/inst/Multiplier_BY/carry1_reg_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
